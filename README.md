# fable2-samples

This is the repository hosting samples for quite all your Fable needs. The best move to start a new Fable project is to clone this repo and then copy/paste one of the projects. There aren't so many files inside each project so that should really be easy.

So what do we have here?

### Easy like 1,2,3

1. **[browser](https://github.com/fable-compiler/fable2-samples/tree/master/browser)**, a simple canvas experiment to get started with Fable and the Browser DOM Api

2. **[nodejs](https://github.com/fable-compiler/fable2-samples/tree/master/nodejs)**, a simple Node.js app with `.fs` files transpiled as independent `.js` files

3. **[nodejsbundle](https://github.com/fable-compiler/fable2-samples/tree/master/nodejsbundle)**, a simple Node.js app bundled into one single `.js` file

4. **[promises](https://github.com/fable-compiler/fable2-samples/tree/master/promises)**, do you like dogs? Display a ::dog:: pic everytime you refresh the page. Here we introduce promises and fetch to get random dog pics!

### Advanced

1. **[minimal](https://github.com/fable-compiler/fable2-samples/tree/master/minimal)**, a great sample featuring a React Single Page Application and Elm architecture. Great to get started with Fable for real.

2. **[fulma](https://github.com/MangelMaxime/fulma-demo)**, full fledged Single Page Application featuring React, Bulma CSS (Fulma) and Elm architecture. The de-facto template for nowadays web apps. We've got you covered with this template.

3. **[mocha](https://github.com/fable-compiler/fable2-samples/tree/master/mocha)**, add tests to your Fable projects with the mocha lib! An easy to understand template with an architecture you can reproduce in already existing Fable projects.

4. **[withPaket](https://github.com/fable-compiler/fable2-samples/tree/master/withpaket)**, desperate to add many .NET NuGet packages without conflicts? Let's use paket in your project!
